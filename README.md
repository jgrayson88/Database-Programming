# Database-Programming
JGAR Clothing web application

The goal of this team project was to build a complete and functional e-commerce website using servlets with a back-end component.

My contribution: implemented the back-end component (Java code and MySQL database including connecting the database to the web application) with a few front-end additions such as inserting the EL to the JSP files to JavaBean attributes; performed testing

My partner: the front-end component: HTML, JSP, CSS
